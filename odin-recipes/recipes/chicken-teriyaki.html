    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Teriyaki (照り焼き) commonly refers to a style of cooking, but it also
      refers to the name of a cooked dish or the sauce that is used to brush
      over the food.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help you understand better: teri (照り) means “luster” given by the
      sweet soy sauce marinade, while yaki (焼き) has a wider definition which
      can denote “cook or pan-fry or grill”. When translated literally, the dish
      means “shiny or glossy grilled chicken” as it describes the lustrous glaze
      on the chicken created by the teriyaki sauce.

    <p>
      There are a lot of teriyaki chicken recipes online, and to be honest, many
      of them have been modified or deviated from the original method. Here are
      a few things you might want to know:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Japanese don’t bake the chicken in the oven or cook them in an
        Instant Pot or cook in a sheet pan with vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        We don’t grill the chicken either as most Japanese homes are too small
        to own a grill.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are no bottled teriyaki sauces in Japan. We make our own sauce
        with usually 4 simple pantry ingredients.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So how do we cook chicken teriyaki in Japan? We pan-fry the chicken over
      the stove until the skin is nicely seared, and then simmer it with the
      sauce until it thickens and caramelizes, leaving the meat with an
      irresistibly glossy finish.
